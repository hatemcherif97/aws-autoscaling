Using Terraform for High Availability with Auto-Scaling Groups
=========

## Resume
--------------
In this project we will create an auto-scaling group that spans two subnets in the default VPC that will automatically scale up or down based on traffic. We will then create a security group that allows traffic from the internet and associate it with the instances. We will also bootstrap an Apache web server to these instances.
